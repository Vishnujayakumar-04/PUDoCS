## Verified Course Classifications

### PG (Postgraduate) Courses

| Course Name | Year | Collection Name | Room | Location | Status |
|------------|------|----------------|------|----------|--------|
| I MSC (Data Analytics) | 1 | `students_pg_msc_da_1` | SH 314 | Second Floor (North) | ✅ Verified |
| I MCA | 1 | `students_pg_mca_1` | SH 367 | Second Floor (South) | ✅ Verified |
| I MSC Int (Computer Science) | 1 | `students_pg_msc_cs_int_1` | SH 308 | Second Floor (East) | ✅ Added |
| I MTECH (Data Science) | 1 | `students_pg_mtech_da_1` | SH 310 | Second Floor (East) | ✅ Verified |
| I MTECH (Computer Science) | 1 | `students_pg_mtech_cse_1` | SH 221 | First Floor (West) | ✅ Verified |
| II MSC (Computer Science) | 2 | `students_pg_msc_cs_2` | SH 321 | Second Floor (West) | ✅ Verified |
| II MCA | 2 | `students_pg_mca_2` | SH 346 | Second Floor (East) | ✅ Verified |

**Note:** "I MTECH (Data Science)" maps to `students_pg_mtech_da_1` (Data Analytics collection) as they are the same program.

### UG (Undergraduate) Courses

| Course Name | Year | Collection Name | Room | Location | Status |
|------------|------|----------------|------|----------|--------|
| I BTECH (CSE) | 1 | `students_ug_btech_cse_1` | 103 | Ground Floor (CS Annexe) | ✅ Verified |
| II BTECH (CSE) | 2 | `students_ug_btech_cse_2` | 203 | First Floor (CS Annexe) | ✅ Verified |
| I BSC (Computer Science) | 1 | `students_ug_bsc_cs_1` | SH 220 | First Floor (West) | ✅ Verified |
| II BSC (Computer Science) | 2 | `students_ug_bsc_cs_2` | 204 | First Floor (CS Annexe) | ✅ Verified |
| III BSC (Computer Science) | 3 | `students_ug_bsc_cs_3` | 205 | First Floor (CS Annexe) | ✅ Verified |

## Updates Made

1. ✅ Added support for "Data Science" mapping to M.Tech Data Analytics collection
2. ✅ Added `students_pg_msc_cs_1` (I MSC CS - Year 1) to collections list
3. ✅ Added `students_pg_msc_cs_int_1` (I MSC CS Integrated - Year 1) to collections list
4. ✅ Added `students_pg_mtech_da_2` (II MTECH Data Science - Year 2) to collections list
5. ✅ Updated program name mappings to include "Data Science" variations
6. ✅ Updated M.Tech Computer Science mapping to handle both "CSE" and "Computer Science" names

## Collection Structure

All courses are correctly classified as:
- **UG (Undergraduate)**: BTECH (CSE), BSC (Computer Science)
- **PG (Postgraduate)**: MSC (CS/DA/CS Integrated), MCA, MTECH (CSE/DA/NIS)

All classroom allocations match the collection structure in the system.
